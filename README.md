### Exploring the dataset and identifying the problem

#### Wine Data

[Vinho verde][1], is a unique product from the Minho region of Portugal. This wine accounts for 15% of the total Portuguese production. The data was collected from May 2004 to Feb 2007 using only protected designation of origin samples tested by the official certification entity (CVRVV), recorded by a computerized system (iLab), which automatically manages wine sample testing from producer requests to lab and sensory analysis.<br>
Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical and sensory variables are available.

#### Wine Quality Dataset

- Input variables(based on physicochemical tests):

        - Fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sufur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol

- Output variable(based on sensory data):

        - Quality, with a score between 0 and 10
